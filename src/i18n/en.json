   "slide-title1":"Government Scheme Guidance Centre",

   "government-paragraf1":"For the social and economic development of the common class, the government runs various welfare schemes. The Government has a noble intention to reach the needy families who are the most marginalized people in the society. Despite the good intentions of the government, due to ignorance of the scheme, when the needy families are unable to directly benefit from the scheme, they take advantage of the middlemen who exploit the poor families financially.",
   "government-paragraf2":"Samast Patidar Samaj Trust, Surat is running Government Scheme Guidance Center with full staff under the leadership of Ex-Minister(R.K) Mr. Nanubhai Vanani to ensure that the needy families get the free benefits of all government schemes in simple and straightforward language. So that the economic exploitation of the poor family stops and the evil of the middlemen is removed.",
   "government-paragraf3":"In this guidance center, not only the guidance of all the schemes of India and the state government, but also the society does all kinds of procedures for filling the off and online forms of the schemes till the amount of the scheme is approved. Suffice it to say about the functioning of this guidance center that it does not stop at just pointing the finger towards the scheme but also holds the finger of the beneficiary and leads to the benefits of the scheme. Due to the above noble work of the society, not only Surat but people of all classes and communities of Gujarat without any caste caste discrimination flock to this guidance center to take advantage of the government schemes.",
